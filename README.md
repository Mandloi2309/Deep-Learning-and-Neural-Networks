# Deep-Learning-and-Neural-Networks
In this repository you will find various experiments performed using deep learning methods

## Image classification
  - In this task, image classification of MNIST dataset was perfromed by implementing a distance based classifier and MLP from scartch (without using keras).
  - Also analzysed the linear separatebility of dataset using our MLP implementation
  - Finally XOR model was implemented using gradient descent. 
  
## Keras
  ### Notebook: MLP CNN MNIST FMNIST
    - Here, MNIST and FMNIST dataset were used to study MLP and CNN which were implemented using Keras.
    - The images were obfuscated by randomly permuting all pixels and affect to these perturbations was analyzed
  ### Notebook: Keras predicting time
    - Finally a deep neural network is to be implemented in order to predict time for a custom dataset containing images of traditional clocks.
## RNN
  - Three types of RNN models were implemented: Simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU
  - Task performed here was to add numbers as string using RNN
  - Also it was analyzed if reversing the strings had any affect on the accuracy or not
